# 🏦 Case Study: Identifying and Preventing Customer Churn
## 📍 Business Situation

A retail bank noticed that customer growth was slowing despite increased marketing spending.

Although new customers were joining, a significant number were quietly leaving each quarter.

Leadership asked:

“Which customers are most at risk of leaving — and how can we prevent it?”

The goal was simple:

Reduce churn

Protect high-value customers

Improve retention profitability

# 🔎 Strategic Findings
## 1️⃣ Customer Engagement Is the Strongest Loyalty Driver

Customers holding only one product were far more likely to leave than those with multiple services.

Meanwhile, customers with 3+ products almost never churned.

### 📌 What This Means for the Bank:

Product integration builds loyalty.

Customers who rely on the bank for multiple financial needs are significantly less likely to switch institutions.

### 💰 Value Opportunity:

Cross-selling campaigns could dramatically reduce churn while increasing revenue per client.

## 2️⃣ Inactivity Is an Early Warning Signal

Inactive customers showed the highest probability of leaving.

Churn did not happen suddenly — it followed a period of disengagement.

### 📌 What This Means:

The bank can detect risk before customers formally close their accounts.

### 💰 Value Opportunity:

A proactive engagement program (alerts, outreach, loyalty offers) could recover at-risk customers early.

Retention becomes preventative rather than reactive.

## 3️⃣ Age Segment Reveals Vulnerability

Customers over 45 showed significantly higher churn rates compared to younger segments.

### 📌 What This Means:

Older clients may:

Expect higher service quality

Compare competitors more actively

Be managing larger financial portfolios

### 💰 Value Opportunity:

Dedicated relationship management for this segment could protect a financially mature and valuable customer base.

## 4️⃣ Geographic Concentration of Churn

Certain regions showed much higher churn levels than others.

### 📌 What This Means:

The issue is not national — it is localized.

Possible drivers:

Regional competition

Service quality differences

Local economic factors

### 💰 Value Opportunity:

Instead of broad marketing campaigns, the bank can deploy targeted regional retention strategies, increasing efficiency and ROI.

## 5️⃣ Balance Patterns Reveal Two Risk Segments

Two distinct churn-risk groups emerged:

Customers with very low balances

Customers with very high balances

### 📌 What This Means:

Low-balance customers:

Likely disengaged

Less attached to the institution

High-balance customers:

May seek better returns or premium services elsewhere

### 💰 Value Opportunity:

Different retention strategies must be applied:

Re-engagement incentives for low-balance clients

Premium loyalty programs for high-net-worth customers

Protecting high-balance clients alone could preserve substantial annual revenue.

## 📊 Overall Strategic Impact

By identifying at-risk customers early, the bank can:

Reduce churn by 5–10%

Improve customer lifetime value

Lower acquisition costs

Increase profitability through targeted retention

Most importantly:

The bank can shift from reacting to churn
to managing churn strategically.
